        "The event kicks off with an inauguration ceremony, marking the official beginning of the hackathon. Participants, sponsors, and organizers gather to introduce the event, its goals, and any special announcements.",
        "Following the inauguration, participants dive into the hackathon. Teams form, ideas are discussed, and coding, designing, and problem-solving activities commence. This marks the start of the intensive hacking period.",
        "A checkpoint is a scheduled break during the hackathon where participants can take stock of their progress, reassess their strategies, and potentially seek assistance or guidance from mentors or organizers. Checkpoint 1 serves as a mid-point evaluation to ensure teams are on track with their projects.",
        "This checkpoint occurs during the late hours of the night to provide teams with an opportunity to review their work, address any challenges or blockers, and possibly pivot their approach if necessary. It ensures that progress is being made and offers support during the demanding overnight period.",
        "As the hackathon progresses into its final stretch, Checkpoint 3 serves as a crucial milestone for teams to evaluate their projects, finalize any remaining tasks, and prepare for the upcoming presentations. It offers a last chance for teams to refine their work before the hackathon concludes.",
        "The official hacking period comes to a close, and teams must wrap up their projects and prepare for the pitching round. This deadline encourages teams to focus their efforts and deliver a tangible outcome within the allocated time frame.",
        "Following the conclusion of the hacking period, teams present their projects to a panel of judges or the wider audience. Each team has a designated time to showcase their work, explain their concept, and highlight its significance or innovation. The pitching round is a crucial opportunity for teams to demonstrate the value and potential of their projects.",
        "The hackathon concludes with a closing ceremony where winners are announced, prizes are awarded, and final remarks are shared. Participants, organizers, sponsors, and other stakeholders come together to celebrate the achievements of the event and reflect on the experiences gained throughout the hackathon."
